# Password Manager
- Use Cases

This script defines a PasswordManager class with methods for encrypting, decrypting, saving, and retrieving passwords. The passwords are stored in a JSON file (data.json) and encrypted using a key stored in a separate file (key.key). Note that this is a basic example, my first atempt and in a real-world application, we would want to enhance security, error handling, and potentially use more sophisticated encryption techniques.
